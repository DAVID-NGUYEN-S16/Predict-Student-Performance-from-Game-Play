        "It's true, they do keep going missing lately.": "290",
        "See?": "382",

        "He's always trying to get you in trouble, and he doesn't like animals!": "137",
        "Slow down, Jo.": "388",
        "But what if Wells kidnapped Teddy?": "42",
        "Then we need evidence.": "435",
        "You're right, Gramps. Let's investigate!": "573",
        "I'm afraid my papers have gone missing in this mess.": "255",
        "You'll have to get started without me.": "571",

        "I found it on an old shirt.": "193",

        "You can talk to a textile expert there.": "561",
        "What's a textile expert?": "514",
        "They study clothes and fabric.": "443",
        "Great! Thanks for the help!": "118",
        "Head over to the university.": "146",
        "Hello there!": "148",
        "Wow! What is all this stuff?": "540",
        "It's our Norwegian Craft exhibit!": "287",
        "Can I give you the tour?": "45",
        "Sorry, I'm in a hurry.": "395",
        "Do you know what this slip is?": "83",
        "Looks like a dry cleaning receipt.": "312",
        "Thanks.": "417",
        "Now I Just need to find all the cleaners from way back in 1916.": "339",
        "Maybe I can help!": "316",
        "I've got a stack of business cards from my favorite cleaners.": "268",
        "Why don't you take a look?": "536",
        "This place was around in 1916! I can start there!": "448",
        "You haven't seen any badgers around here, have you?": "568",
        "Badgers? No.": "34",
        "Okay. Thanks anyway.": "362",
        "Hi! How can I help you?": "164",
        "I need to find the owner of this slip.": "218",
        "Well, I can't show our log books to just anybody.": "481",
        "Please?": "373",
        "It's for Grampa Leo. He's a historian!": "282",
        "Leo... you mean Leopold?": "302",
        "Your gramps is awesome! Always full of stories.": "581",
        "Guess it couldn't hurt to let you take a look.": "120",
        "Here's the log book.": "153",
        "It's a match!": "278",
        "Theodora Youmans must be the owner!": "436",
        "Do you know who Theodora Youmans is?": "85",
        "Hmmm... not sure. Why don't you try the library?": "172",
        "Thanks for the help!": "413",
        "Oh, hello there!": "357",
        "How can I help you?": "179",
        "Have you seen a badger around here?": "130",
        "I'm afraid not.": "256",
        "Please let me know if you do.": "371",
        "I'm also looking for Theodora Youmans. Have you heard of her?": "257",
        "Theodora Youmans? Of course!": "438",
        "Check out our microfiche. It's right through that door.": "60",
        "Youmans was a suffragist!": "578",
        "She helped get votes for women!": "384",
        "Wells! What was he doing here? I should ask the librarian.": "491",
        "What was Wells doing here?": "512",
        "He was looking for a taxidermist.": "135",
        "What's a taxidermist?": "513",
        "Not sure. Here, let me look it up.": "337",
        "\\Taxidermy: the art of preparing, stuffing, and mounting the skins of animals.\\": "586",
        "Oh no... Teddy!": "351",
        "Can you help me find Wells?": "51",
        "You could ask the archivist. He knows everybody!": "564",
        "Jolie! I was hoping you'd stop by. Any news on the shirt artifact?": "295",
        "I haven't quite figured it out just yet...": "206",
        "Well, get on it. I'm counting on you and your gramps to figure this out!": "484",
        "Can you help me? I need to find Wells!": "54",
        "I haven't seen him.": "207",
        "Please? This is really important.": "374",
        "Sorry, can't help you.": "397",
        "Do you have any info on Theodora Youmans?": "80",
        "Theodora Youmans? Is that who owned the shirt?": "437",
        "Yep.": "547",
        "Why didn't you say so?": "528",
        "Youmans was a suffragist here in Wisconsin.": "577",
        "She led marches and helped women get the right to vote!": "385",
        "Wait a sec. Women couldn't vote?!": "464",
        "Nope. But Youmans and other suffragists worked hard to change that.": "333",
        "Thanks to them, Wisconsin was the first state to approve votes for women!": "415",
        "Wow!": "539",
        "Here's a call number to find more info in the Stacks.": "152",
        "Where are the Stacks?": "520",
        "Right outside the door.": "379",
        "Hey, this is Youmans!": "162",
        "And look! She's wearing the shirt!": "22",
        "I should go to the Capitol and tell everyone!": "232",
        "Jo!": "291",
        "Check out the next artifact!": "62",
        "What is it?": "506",
        "I think it's a flag! Pretty interesting, huh?": "241",
        "It's really cool, Gramps. But I'm worried about Teddy.": "288",
        "He's still missing!": "140",
        "We'll find him, Jo.": "475",
        "Want to look for more clues?": "469",
        "We'll find Teddy.": "474",
        "We just have to keep our eyes open!": "470",
        "Hey, look at those scratches!": "160",
        "The kidnapper probably took Teddy on the elevator!": "430",
        "You're right, Jo!": "574",
        "Why isn't the button working?": "537",
        "We'll need a key card.": "476",
        "I had one, but Teddy chewed it up.": "202",
        "I've got Wells's ID!": "267",
        "What should we do next?": "510",
        "I need to take the artifact upstairs. Why don't you investigate those scratch marks?": "222",
        "Okay. I'll try.": "361",
        "Teddy, here I come!": "411",
        "I wonder whose glasses these are.": "246",
        "Teddy!!!": "408",
        "Hang on. I'll get you out of there!": "127",
        "Whoever lost these glasses probably took Teddy!": "527",
        "How can I find out whose glasses these are?": "178",
        "Oh! There was a staff directory in the entryway!": "354",
        "I'll go look at everyone's pictures!": "249",
        "Those are the same glasses!": "449",
        "The archivist must've taken Teddy!": "425",
        "Yes! It's the key for Teddy's cage!": "551",
        "I found the key!": "196",
        "Come on, let's get out of here!": "68",
        "Here's your scarf back!": "154",
        "What are you doing down here?": "500",
        "And how did that badger get free?": "21",
        "I'm here to rescue my friend!": "258",
        "What's going on here?": "516",
        "Thanks for coming, Boss.": "412",
        "I told you!": "243",
        "I captured a badger in our museum!": "185",
        "He's been eating my lunch every day this week!": "138",
        "He has??": "132",
        "I've seen him eating homework and important papers, too.": "269",
        "Jolie- keep your badger under control, or he'll have to go.": "297",
        "And you, Frank-": "28",
        "You can't just steal Jolie's pet.": "562",
        "Ugh. Fine.": "454",
        "Alright, Jolie. Back to work.": "17",
        "Come on, Teddy. Let's go help Gramps!": "65",
        "Let's go help Gramps!": "309",
        "Gramps must be up in the collection room.": "115",
        "Let's go find him!": "308",
        "Teddy! I'm glad to see you.": "406",
        "The archivist had him locked up!": "424",
        "Poor badger.": "377",
        "You're becoming quite the detective, Jo.": "572",
        "Notice any clues about this flag?": "338",
        "Well... it looks hand-stitched.": "487",
        "Good catch!": "107",
        "Go on, tell the boss what you found!": "105",
        "I'm telling you, Boss. Taxidermy is the way to go!": "266",
        "Nonsense. I want live animals at the exhibit, not stuffed ones.": "331",
        "Ah, Jolie! I'm glad you're here.": "14",
        "I'm putting you in charge of the flag case.": "263",
        "Make sure to get some old photos for the exhibit, like last time!": "315",
        "Wait! Can't I do it?": "465",
        "The symbol on the flag looks sort of like a deer hoof.": "433",
        "It could be an early design for the Wisconsin state flag!": "272",
        "Wells, you already have a job to do.": "495",
        "What now, kid?": "508",
        "Do you really think that symbol is a deer hoof?": "86",
        "Not sure.": "335",
        "Do you know where I can find a deer expert?": "84",
        "Hmm. You could try the Aldo Leopold Wildlife Center.": "168",
        "I have to head over there and check out the animals.": "205",
        "I'll ride with you!": "252",
        "Come on, kid. Let's go.": "66",
        "Head over to the Wildlife Center!": "145",
        "I'm sure they'll be able to help.": "264",
        "People sure drink a lot of coffee around here.": "370",
        "I can't believe this.": "182",
        "Ugh...": "457",
        "Oh no! What happened to that crane?": "349",
        "Her beak is stuck in a coffee cup.": "149",
        "It's lucky we found her.": "285",
        "Ugh! Those cups are all over the place.": "453",
        "I need to get her free. She won't hold still!": "219",
        "Can Teddy and I help?": "49",
        "Sure! Give it a try.": "401",
        "Careful. That beak is sharp!": "59",
        "We need to calm her down, Teddy.": "471",
        "Any ideas?": "29",

        "Luckily there are tons of insects around here...": "314",
        "Got one!": "110",
        "Maybe she'll let me take off the cup!": "318",
        "It's OK, girl! Look, I found you a cricket!": "277",
        "You did it! Thanks, kid.": "567",
        "Can I help you with anything?": "46",
        "I'm investigating this symbol.": "260",
        "Does it look like a deer hoof?": "87",
        "There's a diagram of animal tracks over there.": "442",
        "Go take a look!": "106",
        "That hoofprint doesn't match the flag!": "419",
        "Thanks for your help, kid!": "414",
        "So? What'd you find out?": "391",
        "Looks like it's not a deer hoof.": "313",
        "Oh no. If I don't impress the boss soon,  I'm gonna get fired!": "350",
        "Hey, Wells...": "159",
        "I think I might be able to help you.": "239",
        "No thanks. I don't need help from kids.": "328",
        "Are you sure? I know where you can find a real, live badger for the exhibit!": "32",

        "Hmm. Let's see...": "167",
        "Actually, I went to school with somebody who LOVES old flags.": "10",
        "Why don't you go talk to her? I'll let her know you're coming.": "531",
        "Hey, nice dog! What breed is he?": "161",
        "Actually, he's a badger.": "12",
        "Oh, cool! I've never seen a badger in real life.": "356",
        "You've got a million flags here!": "576",
